# **Assignment 7: Legibility, Readability, and Typography**
This assignment demonstrates how the look and feel of a website can be improved by paying careful attention to legibility, readability and typography.  I chose JB Kimani's San Francisco city from assignment 2 for this assignment.

**Font Family used in Assignment 2 website:**
Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif

**Font Families used in Assignment 7 website:**
For the main header & navigation: Playfair Display, Merriweather, serif
For section header & body text: Libre Baskervile, Lora, serif

I chose *Playfair Display*, a google font for the main header and navigation menu because it is a transitional serif font well suited for titles with its very large x-height, short descenders, and extra short capitals

I paired *Playfair Display* with *Libre Baskervile*, a serif google font for the section headers and body text.  The reason I chose Libre
